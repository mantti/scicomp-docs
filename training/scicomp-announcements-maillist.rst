Announcement maillist
=====================

Events and other Aalto Scientific Computing (Science-IT) announcements
distributed over several lists such as the Triton-users and department
mailing lists. In addition
we run the *scicomp-announcements@list.aalto.fi* maillist that covers
everyone else who wants to stay tuned and receive Science IT news.

The moderated list is free to subscribe / unsubscribe at any time,
accepts all emails including non-Aalto ones.
