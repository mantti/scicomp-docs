Implementation
==============

(draft)

Basic services:

* Researchers are selected based on an light application and
  consultation or recommendation from Science-IT.  The RSE program
  balances its time in proportion to its funding from
  schools/departments/groups.

* Ranking criteria includes potential to create lasting improvement of
  skills within a research group, improvement in hardware efficiency,
  number of people benefited, buy-in of group leader, open nature of
  projects (we have a preference for open projects which can serve as
  an example to others), potential for high-impact open software, and
  diversity considerations.

* Typical time frame is generally between one day and a week.

* General timeframe: initial consultation to discuss starting point,
  discussion to decide on target state, RSE provides advice on
  additional training, co-working on the project, follow-up advice as
  needed.  RSE will ideally work from the same office as the
  researcher.


Dedicated service:

* All parameters as agreed in funding discussions.

* Can be implemented as co-funding of salaries or usage fees.

* Time frame typically months or more.  Can include long-term
  maintenance or support at a small full-time equivalent.
