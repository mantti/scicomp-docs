Research Software Engineers
===========================

In 2020, Aalto Scientific Computing is beginning a Research Software/Data
Engineer (RSE) program to improve the quality of our scientific
computing and data use.  "`Research software engineer <rse-def_>`_" is a recent
term for a longstanding role: someone that works at the interface of
research and software development, but not fully either.  We think
this applies equally to data.

.. _rse-def: https://rse.ac.uk/who/

Use of RSEs in research will increase your impact by making your
software more reusable, open, and higher quality.  It will also have
an immense impact on our internal productivity.

It's easy to request help, anywhere from an initial consultation to
longer-term service.  Read more below.

.. note::

   If you are in Aalto, please take `our survey
   <https://forms.gle/wxnCpCGxdUfGGqfw6>`_ to express interest
   (necessary to secure funding) and/or request a consultation.

**This program is currently being developed, and information here may
be updated.**

This is the hands-on compliment our training programs, mainly
:doc:`scientific computing in practice sessions </training/scip/index>` and
`CodeRefinery <https://coderefinery.org>`_.  If you want a kickstart
to put those sessons in practice, this is for you.  Attendance
in these courses is useful but by no means required.
