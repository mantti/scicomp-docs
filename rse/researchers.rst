For researchers and research groups
===================================

You program or analyze data in your daily work, and you know something is missing:
your code and data is less organized, less efficient, less managed than others,
and it's affecting the quality of your work.  Or maybe you don't know
how to start your project, or publish it.  You're too busy with the
science to have time to focus on the computing.

What we do
----------

Our RSEs may provide both mentorship and programming-as-a-service for
your projects.  Are you tired of research being held back by slow
programming?  We can help.

**You can request our help for a few hours, to consult and co-work on
a project.** Our goal will be to primarily teaching and mentoring, to
help you help yourselves in the long run.  We'll point you in the
right direction and where to look next.

**You can also request longer-term programming as a service.**  This
can be producing or modifying some software for you, or whatever you
may need.

Basic examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Setting up a project in version control with all the features.  This
  also includes version control of data.
* Preparing code or data for release and publication
* Creating or automating a workflow, especially those processing data
  or running simulations
* Optimizing some code - both for speed and/or adaptability
* Efficiency storing data for intensive analysis.  Data replication
  and management.
* Making existing software more modular and reusable
* Help properly using, for example, machine learning library
  pipelines, instead of hacking things together yourself
* Setting up automatic software testing
* Transforming projects from individual to collaborative - either
  within a group, or open source.
* Generalized "code clean-up" which takes a project from development
  to stabilized

More involved examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Developing or maintaining specific software, services, demos, or
  implementations.
* Software development as a service
* Software support that lasts beyond the time frame of a single
  student's attention
* Adding features to existing software



Paid project service
--------------------

In the dedicated service, your research groups pays and we will do
whatever you want (in particular the more involved examples above).
Still, our model is as much co-working as consulting: we want to
improve your own skills so that you can still be productive
afterwards.

The research group must pay for this service, but the rate is
essentially at-cost and with minimal bureaucratic overhead.



Free basic service
------------------

In order to help *everyone* and avoid microtransactions,
departments/schools/etc can sponsor a basic service, which provides a
few hours or days of close support to improve how you work (especially
for the "basic examples" above.

One of our trained RSEs will work with you for a short period to begin
or improve your project.  The goal is not to do it for you, but to
show you by example so that you can do it yourself later.
