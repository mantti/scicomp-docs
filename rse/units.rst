For units such as departments
-----------------------------

Our pilot is funded by departments and schools, and members of these
units can receive the basic services free of charge (in accordance to
the shares of funding).  If a research group would like :doc:`dedicated
advanced services <researchers>` (see list above), they will directly
fund this and replace your share.

Benefits to schools/departments:

* Increase the quality of efficiency of your research.  Your
  researchers focus on their science while improving their coding
  skills passively.
* Provide hands-on technical research services to your community at a
  higher level than basic IT.

Benefits to groups:

* Receive staff/on-call software development expertise within your
  group, without having to fund or hire a full-time.
* Your RSEs get joint training and share competence within our RSE
  group.


The RSE program is a part of Aalto Scientific Computing (Science-IT),
so is integrated to our training programs and infrastructure
maintenance.  You don't just get a service, but a connection to a
community of experts.
