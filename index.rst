Narvi user guide for combined FGCI-kickstart
=================

This site is currently placeholder for 
:doc:`FGCI kickstart Tampere <training/scip/summer-kickstart>`

Narvi is the Tampere University high-performance computing cluster.  It serves all
researchers
of TAU, but is currently by `TCSC <https://wiki.eduuni.fi/display/tuttcsc/TCSC+Home>`_. 
It is similar to the CSC
clusters, though CSC clusters are larger and Narvi is easier to use
because it is more integrated into the local environment.
