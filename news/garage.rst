Scicomp garage
==============

The Aalto Scientific Computing Garage is a hands-on help session for
scientific computing and data-intensive research at Aalto organized by
the Science-IT team (Triton/HPC support).  Other teams, such as CSC,
are sometimes present.  It's the best time to get advice and hands-on
help from the people behind scientific computing at Aalto.  This is a
place to get stuff done, so bring your laptop and coffee/food, and
come hang out.

If you need more help than the issue trackers, this is the place to
be.  It's not just Triton, but all aspects of scientific computing.

Come if you want to:

-  Solve problems
-  Discuss what the best strategy are for your problems
-  Network with others who are doing similar work
-  Learn something new
-  Give feedback

  have general questions, no specific question, or want to discuss
  with others even if you won't get one-on-one help.** You can chat
  with us and other users, ask general questions, see what's new, and
  so on.  We'll give guidance from there for advanced cases.

* (Optional) If you want us to prepare or share links/code with us, go
  to the `Triton issue tracker
  <https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/AaltoScienceIT/triton/issues>`_,
  make an issue, and point out that you want to discuss in the garage.
  We will also follow up there afterwards.
