==========================
Aalto Scientific Computing
==========================

This contains documentation about scientific and data-intensive computing
at Aalto and beyond.  It is targeted towards Aalto researchers, but
has some useful information for everyone.  The data management section
is useful even to non-computational researchers.

These docs are maintained by `Aalto Science-IT
<http://science-it.aalto.fi>`_ with the help of the Aalto community.

The Aalto environment
=====================
Aalto provides a wide variety of support for scientific computing.
For a summary, see the `IT Services for Research page
<https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/it-services-for-research>`_.
For information about data storage at Aalto, see the section on data
management below.

Training
========

We have various recommended training courses for researchers who deal
with computation and data.  These courses are selected by researchers,
for researchers and grouped by level of skill needed.

Metadocs
========

These docs are open source: all content is licensed under CC-BY 4.0
and all examples under CC0 (public domain).  Additionally, this is an
*open project* and we *strongly* encourage anyone to :doc:`contribute
<README>`.  For information, see the :doc:`README` and the Github
links at the top of every page.  Either make Github issues, pull
requests, or ask for direct commit access.  Be bold: the biggest
problem is missing information, and mistakes can always be fixed.
