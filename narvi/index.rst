Narvi user guide
=================

Narvi is the Tampere Universities high-performance computing cluster.  It serves all
researchers of universitys, but is currently coordinated from within the Tampere Center of
Scientific Computing. 
It is similar to the CSC
clusters, though CSC clusters are larger and Narvi is easier to use
because it is more integrated into the local environment.
