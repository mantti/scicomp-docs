Connecting to Triton
====================


All access to Triton is via Secure Shell (ssh).

You can connect to ``triton.aalto.fi`` from Aalto and CSC networks.
Aalto networks include: Wired workstation networks, ``eduroam``, and
the ``aalto`` wireless network *only if you are using an Aalto managed
laptop* (otherwise ``aalto`` is like ``aalto open``).  If you connect
to the Aalto VPN, you will be on the Aalto networks.

For SSHing to Triton from outside of your department or CSC, please
login first to a university server (like ``kosh.aalto.fi`` or
``taltta.org.aalto.fi``) and then open a session to
``triton.aalto.fi``.

.. note::

   Are you here for a SciComp KickStart course?  You just need to :doc:`make
   sure you have an account <../accounts>` and then be able to connect
   via ssh (first section here), and you don't need to worry about the
   graphical application parts.  Everything else, we do tomorrow.

.. note::

   Triton uses Aalto accounts, but your :doc:`account must be
   activated first <../accounts>`.

.. seealso::

      The :doc:`shell crash course </scicomp/shell>` is a prerequisite
      to this material.


There are different ways of connecting:

      * From where?
    * * ssh
      * Works everywhere, from everywhere.  Firewalls may make things
	hard sometimes.
      * Aalto networks only, otherwise ssh to kosh and then Triton
    * * https://jupyter.triton.aalto.fi
      * Jupyter interface, but provides shell access via web browser.
      * Whole internet
    * * https://vdi.aalto.fi
      * Virtual desktop, from there you have to ``ssh`` to Triton
	anyway but gets you past firewalls and can run graphical
	programs via SSH.
      * Whole internet


Connecting via ssh
==================

Linux
-----

All Linux distributions come with an ``ssh`` client, so you don't need to do
anything.  To use graphical applications, use the standard ``-X`` option,
nothing extra needed.::

  ssh triton.aalto.fi
  # OR, if your username is different:
  ssh username@triton.aalto.fi

If you are from outside the Aalto networks::

    ssh kosh.aalto.fi         # or ssh username@kosh.aalto.fi
    ssh triton.aalto.fi

Mac
---

``ssh`` is installed by default, same as Linux.  Run it from a terminal,
same command as Linux.  To run graphical applications, you need to
install an X server (XQuartz).

Windows
-------

You need to install a ssh client yourself:  `PuTTY <https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>`__ is
the standard one.  If you want to run graphical programs, you need an X server on
Windows: see this
`link <http://www.geo.mtu.edu/geoschem/docs/putty_install.html>`__ for
some hints.  (Side note: putty dot org is an advertisement site trying to
get you to install something else.)

You should configure this with the hostname, username, and save the
settings so that you can connect quickly.

If you are outside the Aalto networks, you need to first connect to
``kosh.aalto.fi`` or some other server, and then use the Linux
instructions to connect to Triton.

Advanced options
----------------

You can :doc:`verify the ssh key fingerprints <../usage/ssh-fingerprints>`.

See the :doc:`advanced ssh information </scicomp/ssh>` to learn how
to log in without a password, automatically save your username 
and more. It really will save you time.

``ssh`` is one of the most fundamental Linux programs: by using it
well, you can really do almost anything from anywhere.  The
``.ssh/config`` file is valuable to set up.  If ssh is annoying to
use, ask for some help in getting it working well.  



Exercise
--------

1. Connect to Triton.  List your home directory and work directory
   ``$WRKDIR``.

2. Check the uptime and load of the login node: ``uptime`` and
   ``htop`` (``q`` to quit).  What else can you learn about the node?

3. Check what your default shell is: ``echo $SHELL``.  Go ahead and
   change your shell to bash if it's not yet (see below).



Change your shell to bash (Aalto)
---------------------------------

*Only needed if you shell isn't already* ``bash``.

The thing you are interacting with when you type is the **shell** -
the layer around the operating system.  ``bash`` is the most common
shell, but the Aalto default shell used to be ``zsh`` (which is more
powerful in some ways, but harder to teach with).  For new users (if
you joined Aalto after autumn 2018) you should have bash as the
default. We recommend that you check and change your shell to bash.

You can determine if your shell is bash by running ``echo $SHELL``.
Does it say ``/bin/bash``?

If not, ``ssh`` to ``kosh.aalto.fi`` and run ``chsh -s /bin/bash``.
It may take 15 minutes to update, and you will need to log in again.



Connecting via https://jupyter.triton.aalto.fi
==============================================

Jupyter is a web-based way of doing computing.  But what some people
forget is that it has a full-featured terminal and console included.

Go to https://jupyter.triton.aalto.fi (not **.cs.**\ aaalto) and log
in.  Select "Slurm 5 day, 2G" and start.

To start a terminal, click File→New→Terminal - you do anything you
need to do from here, same as ``ssh``.  If you need to edit text
files, you can also do that through JupyterLab (note: change to the
right directory *before* creating a new file!).

To learn more about Jupyterlab, you need to read up elsewhere, there
are plenty of tutorials.



Connecting via https://vdi.aalto.fi
===================================

If you go to https://vdi.aalto.fi, you can access a cloud-based Aalto
workstation.  HTML access works from everywhere, or download the
"VMWare Horizon Client" for a better connection.  Start a Ubuntu
desktop (you get Aalto Ubuntu).  From there, you **have to use the
normal ssh instructions** (via the Terminal application) using the
instructions you see above: ``ssh triton.aalto.fi``.

For more information, see `it.aalto.fi
<https://it.aalto.fi/instructions/aalto-university-virtual-desktop-infrastructure-vdiaaltofi>`__.
